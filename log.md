# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 7, 2020

**Today's Progress:**

Today was the setup day for this challenge. Given below are some of my goals,

1. Complete the full stack certification offered by freeCodeCamp along with the challenges specified in The Odin Project
2. Get a strong foundation in HTML, CSS and especially JS by working on various projects
3. Get good with the MERN (Mongo DB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS) stack
4. Build my portfolio website

**Thoughts:**

Spent ~2 hours and finished the Basic HTML and CSS challenges as part of the Responsive Web Design Certification

### Day 2: September 9, 2020

**Today's Progress:**

Completed Visual Design, Accesibility and Responsive Design challenges. Understood importance of new HTML5 tags (nav, section, header, footer, article etc) in the context of accessibility, css animations etc. Wanted to finish flexbox and grid and start with projects tomorrow but got bored.

**Thoughts:**

These challenges got very boring today. I wonder how much I will remember of what I do or how useful they will be for me as most of them just involve changing few lines of code in the editor.

### Day 3: September 10, 2020

**Today's Progress:**

Finished flexbox and grid challenges. Already had a headstart with these two before. Started with the responsive design projects

**Thoughts:**

Understood the power of flexbox and grid in particular. Wonder what the future has in store one day when people find faults with CSS grid.
