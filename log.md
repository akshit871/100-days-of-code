# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 7, 2020

**Today's Progress:**

Today was the setup day for this challenge. Given below are some of my goals,

1. Complete the full stack certification offered by freeCodeCamp along with the challenges specified in The Odin Project
2. Get a strong foundation in HTML, CSS and especially JS by working on various projects
3. Get good with the MERN (Mongo DB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS) stack
4. Build my portfolio website

**Thoughts:**

Spent ~2 hours and finished the Basic HTML and CSS challenges as part of the Responsive Web Design Certification

### Day 2: September 9, 2020

**Today's Progress:**

Completed Visual Design, Accesibility and Responsive Design challenges. Understood importance of new HTML5 tags (nav, section, header, footer, article etc) in the context of accessibility, css animations etc. Wanted to finish flexbox and grid and start with projects tomorrow but got bored.

**Thoughts:**

These challenges got very boring today. I wonder how much I will remember of what I do or how useful they will be for me as most of them just involve changing few lines of code in the editor.

### Day 3: September 10, 2020

**Today's Progress:**

Finished flexbox and grid challenges. Already had a headstart with these two before. Started with the responsive design projects

**Thoughts:**

Understood the power of flexbox and grid in particular. Wonder what the future has in store one day when people find faults with CSS grid.

### Day 4: September 11, 2020

**Today's Progress:**

Started work on a tribute page using CSS Grid. Couldn't complete what I wanted to do. Wanted to add a scroll for the timeline but didn't figure out how.

**Thoughts:**

I should have taken less time to complete the tribute page but I messed up. Have to revisit grid, check what I have to change to get the required result.

### Day 5: September 14, 2020

**Today's Progress:**

Finished work on the tribute page (First responsive design project on FreeCodeCamp). Learnt about viewport units, object-fit, object-position properties, replaced elements. pseudo elements etc. Built a [vertical response timeline](https://github.com/Mathunes/timeline) by modifying it as per my use case.

**Thoughts:**

Completed Tribute Page work. 1 down 4 to go. Took a lot of time to complete the work, but I think I will improve as time passes and I work on more projects. Still need to understand a lot of things clearly.

### Day 6: September 15, 2020

**Today's Progress:**

Finished work on the survey form (Second responsive design project on FreeCodeCamp). Learnt about various form fields, datafield vs select, setting a perfect full page background image using background-size property etc

**Thoughts:**

Completed Survey Form work. 2 down 3 to go. Target was to complete all the remaining 3 projects also today but I think I am setting lofty/impractical goals.
