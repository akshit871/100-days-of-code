# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 7, 2020

**Today's Progress:**

Today was the setup day for this challenge. Given below are some of my goals,

1. Complete the full stack certification offered by freeCodeCamp along with the challenges specified in The Odin Project
2. Get a strong foundation in HTML, CSS and especially JS by working on various projects
3. Get good with the MERN (Mongo DB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS) stack
4. Build my portfolio website

**Thoughts:**

Spent ~2 hours and finished the Basic HTML and CSS challenges as part of the Responsive Web Design Certification
