# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [K Prem Kiran]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [September 7, Monday, 2020].

## Log

### R1D0

Spent ~2 hours and finished the Basic HTML and CSS challenges as part of the Responsive Web Design Certification

### R1D1

Have to improve tomorrow after a poor start

### R1D2

These challenges got very boring today. I wonder how much I will remember of what I do or how useful they will be for me as most of them just involve changing few lines of code in the editor.

### R1D3

Understood the power of flexbox and grid in particular. Wonder what the future has in store one day when people find faults with CSS grid.

### R1D4

I should have taken less time to complete the tribute page but I messed up. Have to revisit grid and check what I have to change to get the required result.

### R1D5

Completed Tribute Page work. 1 down 4 to go. Took a lot of time to complete the work, but I think I will improve as time passes and I work on more projects. Still need to understand a lot of things clearly.
